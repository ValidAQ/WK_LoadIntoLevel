# White Knuckle - Load Into Playground

This mod allows you to load into the Dev Playground directly upon starting the game or instead of a specific gamemode - e.g. the tutorial.

By default, it drops you directly into the playground when you launch the game.

You can choose the scene to be replaced by the playground in the mod config file.
For example, to launch the playground instead of the tutorial, set `PlaygroundScene` to `Training-Level`.

The config file can be found at `<Game Directory>\BepInEx\config\com.validaq.loadintoplayground.cfg`
